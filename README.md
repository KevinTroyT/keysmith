# Keysmith

Hierarchical Deterministic Key Derivation for the Internet Computer

[![Build Status](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

## Introduction

Keysmith lets you derive cryptographic keys and identifiers for the Internet Computer. Among these identifiers includes an account identifier, which indicates the source or destination of an ICP token transfer. Keysmith does not sign or send messages to the Internet Computer. Hence, Keysmith does not facilitate ICP token transfer, but rather only ICP token custody. For use cases other than custody, such as payments, consider using Keysmith in conjunction with other software, such as the DFINITY Canister SDK.

## Download

Download the latest tarball [here](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith/releases).

## Verify

If you want to verify the authenticity of the tarball, then please also download the supplementary `SHA256.SIG` and `SHA256.SUM` files, as well as my public key, which you can find [here](https://sovereign.io/public.key).

Verify the SHA256 checksum of the tarball.

```text
grep "$(openssl dgst -sha256 keysmith-*.tar.gz)" SHA256.SUM
```

Verify the signature on the tarball.

```text
openssl dgst -verify public.key -signature SHA256.SIG SHA256.SUM
```

The command above should display the following output.

```text
Verified OK
```

## Install

Extract the executable from the tarball.

```text
tar -f keysmith-*.tar.gz -x 
```

Move the executable to a suitable location.

```text
sudo mv keysmith /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage

Below is list of commands and their behavior.

- `account` prints your account identifier.
- `generate` generates your mnemonic seed.
- `legacy-address` prints your legacy address.
- `principal` prints your principal identifier.
- `private-key` writes your private key to a file.
- `public-key` prints your public key.
- `version` prints the version number.
- `x-public-key` prints your extended public key.

# Modify


Add customize txt filename support.
network service

## Usage

#### customize filename
```text
keysmith <command> <filename>
```

#### network service
```text
keysmith netservice start
```
service will start at 127.0.0.1:8081

## TODO

- `keysmith netservice -p 8000` change ports
- `keysmith <command> -f <filename>`
